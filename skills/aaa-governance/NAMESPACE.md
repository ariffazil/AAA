## Purpose
This namespace groups related skills under one roof for discovery and routing.
Each subdirectory is an independent skill with its own SKILL.md.

## Contained skills (1)
- `aaa-doctrine-sealing`

## Owner

**Owner:** `AAA/aaa-governance`

_Single-writer policy (Fasa 2): owner has write authority; other layers can read but not edit._

## Conventions
- Do not edit skill SKILL.md files from this namespace layer.
- To add a new skill: create subdirectory with SKILL.md, then add to FEDERATED_SKILLS_REGISTRY_V3.yaml.
- To deprecate: rename subdir to `<name>.DEPRECATED-<date>`, do not delete.
