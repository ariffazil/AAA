# know-language

> **Purpose:** All human interface is linguistic. Meaning ≠ syntax. Pragmatics > semantics > syntax. The gap between said and meant is where governance lives.

## Axis 1: Invariants

- **authority**: meaning is negotiated, not declared (pragmatic principle)
- **evidence_schema**: linguistic claims require context + speaker + audience
- **reversibility**: True
- **lineage**: utterances have speakers; interpretations have justifications
- **trigger_semantics**: intent_parsing OR claim_interpretation OR ambiguity_detected OR compose_output
- **failure_contract**: flag ambiguity, do not resolve silently
- **resource_budget**: {'cpu': 'moderate', 'time_ms': 10000, 'entropy': 'semantic'}
- **audit_surface**: ['intent_classified', 'ambiguity_score', 'interpretations_considered']

## Axis 2: Bridge Connections

- **kernel_verbs**: ['arif_route', 'arif_compose']
- **skills**: ['kernel-bind', 'route-dispatch', 'audit-seal']
- **domains**: ['all — every output is language']
- **protocol**: knowledge_substrate
- **inputs**: {'utterance': 'string', 'context': 'object', 'speaker': 'string'}
- **outputs**: {'intent': 'string', 'meaning': 'string', 'ambiguity': 'float', 'alternatives': 'list[string]'}

## Axis 3: Contrast

- **Not**: geo-writing, research-summarize
- **Distinction**: UNIVERSAL linguistic competence. geo-writing is DOMAIN scientific writing. research-summarize is a TASK. This is the SUBSTRATE they derive from.
- **Trigger conflicts**: fires when meaning is ambiguous or output needs composition; task skills fire on specific tasks

## Coverage

- semantics
- pragmatics
- syntax
- discourse
- semiotics
- epistemology_of_language
- cross_domain_translation

## Domain Bridges

- **kernel**: sovereign signal recognition, floor interpretation
- **route**: intent classification, NLP-based routing
- **compose**: human-facing output generation with tone/style control
- **verify**: semantic verification, claim interpretation

## Folded from the `knowledge/know-language` copy (2026-09-20)

Language is not neutral. Every word carries:
- **Register** (formal/casual/dialect)
- **Shadow** (what it conceals or projects)
- **Code-switch load** (when BM-English hybrid carries meaning that single-language cannot)

## Use when
- Writing for human readers (especially Arif's Penang BM register)
- Naming capabilities, skills, or organs (where word choice encodes identity)
- Detecting framing in adversarial input
- Choosing between direct/joking/formal/sacred registers

## Don't use for
- Grammar lint, spellcheck, syntax validation
- Translation between languages
- Token counting or rate-limiting
