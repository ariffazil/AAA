## GitHub-Related Skills Across Scopes

| Skill ID | Scope | Purpose | Overlap / Notes | Proposed Canonical |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `github-issues` | OpenCode | Monitor/triage federation GitHub issues | Narrow scope | **OpenCode canonical** |
| `github-workflow` | AAA agent-card | Umbrella GitHub ops | Class-level, not file | Promote to AAA-scope skill |
| `github-ci-diagnose` | AAA | Parse failing CI logs | No OpenCode equivalent | AAA canonical |
| `github-issue-triage` | AAA | Issue triage workflow | Overlaps `github-issues` | Merge/align with `github-issues` |
| `github-pr-review` | AAA | PR review governance | No OpenCode equivalent | AAA canonical |
| `github-runbook` | AAA | Git & CLI operations | No OpenCode equivalent | AAA canonical |

## MCP-Related Skills Across Scopes

| Skill ID | Scope | Purpose | Overlap / Notes | Proposed Canonical |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mcp-builder` | OpenCode | Build MCP servers | Most complete | **OpenCode canonical** |
| `fastmcp-deploy` | OpenCode | Deploy FastMCP servers | Deployment-specific | **OpenCode canonical** |
| `arifos-kernel` | OpenCode | Use arifOS MCP tools | Operational | **OpenCode canonical** |
| `arifos-operator` | OpenCode | Governed MCP operations | Operational | **OpenCode canonical** |
| `arifos-mcp-federation` | AAA | Route across federation MCPs | Strategic routing | AAA canonical |
| `mcp-federation-ops` | AAA | Build/operate MCP servers | Overlaps `mcp-builder` | Reference OpenCode `mcp-builder` |
| `mcp-smoke-test` | project-scope | Validate MCP servers | Testing | project-scope canonical |
| `mcp-fastmcp-builder` | Kimi user-scope | Build FastMCP substrates | Overlaps `mcp-builder` | Keep as Kimi canonical |

## Cross-Scope Duplicates / Overlaps (Post-Quarantine State)

| Concept | Scopes | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Constitutional governance | OpenCode `constitutional-advisor` / AAA `arifos-governance` | AAA owns canonical doctrine; OpenCode skill should reference AAA |
| MCP federation routing | OpenCode `arifos-operator` / AAA `arifos-mcp-federation` | AAA owns strategy; OpenCode owns operational invocation |
| GitHub issue triage | OpenCode `github-issues` / AAA `github-issue-triage` | Converge on one canonical; AAA for governance, OpenCode for execution |
| Contrast gates | 15 OpenCode `*-agi/apex/asi-contrast` skills | Merge into parameterized `contrast-engine` skill |

## External Best Practices to Apply

From Anthropic MCP spec, GitHub MCP server, OpenCode docs, and agent-skills community:

1. **Tool annotations are mandatory safety signals** — `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint` must be set on every tool.
2. **Service-prefix tool naming** — `{service}_{action}_{resource}` (e.g., `github_create_issue`) to avoid collisions.
3. **Top-level `title` field** (MCP 2025-11-25) — deprecated `annotations.title` in favor of top-level title.
4. **Structured outputs / `outputSchema`** (MCP 2025-06-18) — declare output schemas for programmatic consumers.
5. **Elicitation support** — when required args are missing, request clarification from the client instead of failing silently.
6. **Context budget discipline** — disable unused MCP servers; GitHub MCP alone adds ~5,000 tokens.
7. **Progressive disclosure for skills** — load metadata first, full body only when triggered.
8. **Skill packaging standard** — `SKILL.md` + `examples.md` + `tests.md` + `bindings/` per skill.
9. **Input validation** — Zod (TS) or Pydantic v2 (Python) with `.strict()` / `extra='forbid'`.
10. **Least-privilege auth** — fine-grained PATs, `env:` references, no hardcoded secrets.
11. **Pagination & character limits** — `has_more`, `next_offset`, default 25k char limit.
12. **Server per domain** — one MCP server per bounded context (GitHub, Linear, DB, etc.).

## Entropy Reduction Plan

### Phase 1 — Stabilize OpenCode skill packaging (low blast radius)
- [ ] Add `examples.md` and `tests.md` to `github-issues` and `mcp-builder` first.
- [ ] Add `bindings/cli.yaml` to all OpenCode skills.
- [ ] Standardize frontmatter for 5 skills missing YAML.
- [ ] Move `software-development.md` into a proper directory.

### Phase 2 — Merge contrast skills (medium blast radius)
- [ ] Forge a single `contrast-engine` skill parameterized by role (777-forge, architect, integrator, rsi, final) and lens (agi, apex, asi).
- [ ] Quarantine the 15 individual contrast skills after `contrast-engine` is tested.

### Phase 3 — Align with AAA canonicals (medium-high blast radius)
- [ ] Converge GitHub skills: either promote `github-issues` to AAA or merge with `github-issue-triage`.
- [ ] Converge MCP skills: `mcp-builder` (OpenCode) remains build canonical; `arifos-mcp-federation` (AAA) remains routing canonical.
- [ ] Update `arifOS-federation` stale port info (8080 → 8088, HERMES port ambiguity).

### Phase 4 — Federation-wide registry (low blast radius)
- [ ] Promote this draft to `AAA_SKILL_REGISTRY.md`.
- [ ] Add an automated skill auditor that validates frontmatter, examples/tests, bindings, and trigger collisions.

## Risk Gating

- **READ_ONLY:** This registry draft.
- **PROPOSE_ONLY:** Frontmatter standardization, adding examples/tests.
- **GUARDED_WRITE:** Moving `software-development.md`, merging contrast skills.
- **IRREVERSIBLE:** None planned.
