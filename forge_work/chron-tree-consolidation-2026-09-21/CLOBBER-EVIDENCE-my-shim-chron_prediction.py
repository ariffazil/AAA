# ───────────────────────── RECALIBRATION (the broken learning hop) ─────────────────────────
#
# 2026-09-21 (learning-loop closure). Before this section, ``load_calibration()``
# had ZERO callers outside its own definition: OUTCOME→LEARNING wrote
# calibration.json and lessons.jsonl every cycle, and nothing read them. The loop
# was Predict → Verify → Learn → WRITE FILE. A ledger, not a loop.
#
# The rule below is what makes a verified outcome change a future confidence.
#
# SHRINKAGE RULE — two-component linear shrinkage (empirical Bayes)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Let, for a new prediction with generator-proposed confidence p ∈ [0,1]:
#   n   = effective_n      decisive scored verdicts in the snapshot
#   m   = classified_n     decisive verdicts whose outcome is INTERPRETABLE:
#                          correct verdicts (error_type NONE) plus failures whose
#                          error class was actually measured (not UNKNOWN)
#   ā   = accuracy         = measured hit rate
#   c̄   = mean_confidence  = what the store said at birth
#   δ   = c̄ − ā            = reliability-in-the-large (δ>0 ⇒ overconfident)
#
#   w       = m / (m + κ)                     posterior weight on the evidence
#   anchor  = ā            if skill usable     "shrink toward the measured base rate"
#           = 0.5          otherwise           "shrink toward genuine uncertainty"
#   δ_eff   = δ            if not usable and δ measurable, else 0
#
#   c_cal = clamp01( (1 − w)·p + w·anchor − w·δ_eff )
#
# Basis, component by component:
#
# 1. w = m/(m+κ) IS the Beta–Binomial posterior weight. Treating the hit rate as
#    Beta(α,β) with prior mean μ₀ and strength κ = α+β, the posterior mean after m
#    observations with k hits is (k + α)/(m + κ) = w·(k/m) + (1−w)·μ₀ — exactly a
#    convex blend at weight w. κ is therefore not a fudge factor; it is "how many
#    pseudo-observations of doubt". κ = 8 is deliberately conservative: at m = 2 it
#    puts w = 0.20, so four-fifths of the answer stays with the proposal and no
#    confident correction is possible from two outcomes. (Jeffreys α=β=0.5 → κ=1
#    would put w = 0.67 at m=2 — far too permissive for a store this young;
#    Haldane α=β=0 → κ=0 is degenerate, w ≡ 1.)
#
# 2. The anchor carries the variance-awareness. When the store cannot support a
#    skill estimate the anchor is 0.5 — GENUINE UNCERTAINTY, not the measured
#    frequency, because a 2-sample frequency is not an estimate of anything.
#
# 3. δ_eff applies ONLY in the not-usable branch. In the usable branch accuracy is
#    trusted, so overconfidence is already priced in: a proposal above ā is pulled
#    down BY THE PULL TOWARD ā. Adding δ there too would double-count the same
#    bias — the error that would let a 60-sample overconfident store drive a 0.9 to
#    0.02. In the not-usable branch ā itself is not trusted, so the measured
#    DIRECTION of the bias is the only remaining usable signal and is applied at
#    the same weight.
#
# 4. Bound: |c_cal − p| ≤ w·(|anchor − p| + |δ_eff|) ≤ 2w. The correction can never
#    exceed twice the weight of evidence; at m = 2 that is 0.4, and it is measured
#    at 0.081 on the live store. The bound is derived from m, never hardcoded.
#
# Known limitation, disclosed rather than hidden: with a corrected-but-not-
# binned model, a proposal far from ā is pulled toward ā on evidence from ALL
# claims, not from claims stated near p. A per-bin reliability curve (needs the
# n the store does not yet have) would correct that. Until then w < 1 keeps the
# pull bounded.
